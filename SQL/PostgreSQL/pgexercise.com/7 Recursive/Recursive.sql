Produce a CTE that can return the upward recommendation 
chain for any member. You should be able to select 
recommender from recommenders where member=x. 
Demonstrate it by getting the chains for members 12 
and 22. Results table should have member and 
recommender, ordered by member ascending, recommender 
descending.
